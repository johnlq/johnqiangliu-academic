I'm an Associate Professor at Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA). Currently, I mainly focus on data mining, recommender systems, graph neural networks, fake news detection and AI for science. Before that, I received my PhD degree from CASIA, where I mainly focused on recommender systems and text mining.
